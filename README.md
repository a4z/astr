# astr, compile-time array string

Example code related to the blog post ['Compile time string literals processing, but why'](https://a4z.gitlab.io/blog/2023/11/04/Compiletime-string-literals-processing.html).

There are two examples, getting short file names and getting type names.

- File names work as described in the blog post.
- Type names work for a set of use cases but is not a universal solution or replacement for reflections.
